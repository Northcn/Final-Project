        <p class="Intro"><b>Guinea Pigs cannot live alone as they are social creatures and will get depressed. They must live in pairs or more.</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Hay makes up 80% of their diet</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Female guinea pigs are referred as sows and male guinea pigs are referred as boars</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Boars are much harder to bond then sows because they are much more territorial, so it's recommended to only keep 2 boars together
        <br>But you can usually have more then 2 sows bonded and living together.</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Guinea Pigs wheek for many reasons like food, excitement, or you did something that made them happy.</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Happy Guinea Pigs "popcorn". Like corn kennels popping, Guinea Pigs also jump into the air unexpectedly when their happy.</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>They can hear way better than humans. So if you live in a noisy environment, Guinea Pigs aren't the right pets.</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Some breeds need special care like Hairless Guinea Pigs need a healthy diet to keep their skin healthy, and whenever they have dry skin you must apply coconut or almond oil
        <br>You must also have a comfortable room temperature and have extra heating sources since they have no fur to keep them warm</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Long-haired breeds need regular grooming and sometimes help cleaning themselves since their fur is more likely to get dirty</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Guinea Pigs need nail trims once every month, or if you prefer every 2-3 weeks.</b></p>
        <p class="Intro"><b>Guinea Pigs are considered <strong>EXOTIC PETS</strong> so you cannot take them to just any vet, it must be an exotic vetenarian which can be difficult to find or a far drive
        <br>And an exotic vet is usually more expensive than a regular vet</b></p>
